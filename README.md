# Exercise Search

Simple React Native app for searching for physical exercises in an open web database.

## Description

Test task for a position of React Native developer.

## Additional info

This app is very small and it is the reason for some decisions:

* This project was built with Expo.
* Api key is hardcoded in purpose. This key is for a public api and the project have no dedicated server to store an api key on.

The app has three screens - Search form, Search results and Exercise details. The details screen is for more comfortable reading of an exercise instructions cause it's pretty long text.
